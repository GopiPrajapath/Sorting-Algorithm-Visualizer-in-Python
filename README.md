# 🧮 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer (Console-Based)

A simple, console-based Sorting Algorithm Visualizer built in Python.  
This project allows users to interactively select and run different sorting algorithms on an array — while also tracking the number of comparisons, swaps, and total execution time.
